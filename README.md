# SSH Honeypot

This Python script is an SSH honeypot designed to log authentication attempts (username and password combinations) made by clients trying to connect to the server. The project is implemented using Python and the `paramiko` library to handle SSH connections.

## Features
- Listens on port `2222` for incoming SSH connections.
- Logs all username and password attempts to a `logins.txt` file.
- Uses a generated RSA key pair for the SSH server.
- Handles multiple client connections using threading.

## Requirements
- Python
- `paramiko` library

### Install Dependencies
You can install the `paramiko` library using `pip`:

```bash
pip install paramiko
```

## How to Generate SSH Keys
Before running the honeypot, you need to generate RSA keys for the SSH server using the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f server.key
```

This will generate a `server.key` file which the honeypot will use for SSH connections.

## How to Run the Honeypot

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Generate the SSH keys (if not already done).
3. Run the script:

```bash
python2.7 honeypot.py
```

The server will start listening on port `2222` for incoming SSH connections. All login attempts will be logged in the `logins.txt` file.

## Logs
- **paramiko.log**: Logs generated by the `paramiko` library.
- **logins.txt**: File containing the logged username and password combinations from authentication attempts.

## Warning
This honeypot is intended for **educational purposes only**. Ensure you use it responsibly and in environments where you have permission to monitor traffic.
